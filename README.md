# Ledger — Decentralized Budget Tracker

A privacy-first, local-first budget tracking application with an intelligent Python machine learning backend and a minimalist Vanilla JS frontend.

---

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Pure Vanilla JS with IndexedDB for 100% private, browser-local data storage. Styled with a custom "Castle" dark aesthetic. Features a native CSS category breakdown chart.
- **Backend / ML Engine:** FastAPI monolith serving static assets and ML predictions. Uses **Scikit-Learn** (`RandomForestClassifier` for automated expense categorization and `LinearRegression` for spending forecasting).
